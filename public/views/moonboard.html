                <h1 class="margin-bottom-lv1">Problem</h1>
                <p class="margin-bottom-lv3">
                    When the Moonboard was first released, the training apparatus dominated the climbing scene. 
                    However, due to the recent growth of the sport, other types of training boards such as Kilterboard and Tension Board have started to overtake 
                    Moonboard in social popularity. This is due to Kilter and Tension's strong social media presence, with climbers having the ability to upload 
                    and view videos on the board‚Äôs mobile apps. 
                </p>
                <img class="margin-bottom-lv3" src="../assets/moonboard/classic.png" alt="classic">
                
                <p> Compared to the other training boards, Moonboard‚Äôs mobile app is outdated, with new and experienced climbers even struggling 
                    to navigate the basics of the app. Without the core functionality working, Moonboard cannot even begin to compete in social 
                    media against its competitors.

                <p class="margin-bottom-lv8">
                    From insights pulled from our user interviews, we built an experience design strategy around three key objectives: facilitating problem discovery, enriching training, and building community. The redesigned app features a simplified navigation and filtering system based on feedback from new and experienced users. Additionally, we created a new design language to represent the stoke of the community ü§ô.

                        Climbers can scroll down for additional information that helps them choose a climb suitable to their 
                        skill level.</p>

                            We polished it up by only including the bare essentials needed to judge the 
                            quality of a climb, reducing cognitive overhead.

                            accessing climbs in the original app was difficult due to the interaction design. We decided to
                             simplify this by following current interaction design patterns by moving the ‚Äúsave‚Äù button to 
                             the top right.

                             to a list or logbook can mean the same thing, which guided the redesign to separate them into

                            <p class="margin-bottom-lv6">
                                In a user interview we discovered that climbers want a simplified method to filter 
                                climbs based on three main determinants:

                                <br><br>

                                <b>Benchmarked Climbs</b> - Is the climb verified by the MoonBoard community?
                                <br>
                                <b>Completion Number</b> - Is it even possible to climb?
                                <br>
                                <b>Star Rating</b> - How well does the climb combine strength and technique?

                                <br><br>

                                Our new filtering page also auto converts between Font or V grading. The Font scale 
                                is commonly used in Europe, and the V scale is used in North America to grade climbs. 
                                This way, climbers don‚Äôt have to convert between the two systems.
