                    taking a deep dive into the informal conversation habits of knowledge workers in North America. 
                    Within the project, our team conducted a literature review and user interviews to ultimately build a 
                    research report documenting COVID-19’s impact on project teams. This report informed our solution — 
                    Workestra, a new interaction for remote teams with the aim to reduce social isolation throughout the workday. </p>

                <h1 class="margin-bottom-lv1 margin-top-lv8">Problem</h1>
                <p class="margin-bottom-lv4">Due to COVID-19, companies have moved team collaboration solely online, 
                    causing 4.7 million Canadians to depend on online communication systems. According to the Angus 
                    Reid Institute, “the percentage of [Canadians] saying that [video calling] makes them feel truly
                     connected has plummeted as usage has increased.” Authentic interactions such as spur-of-the-moment 
                     conversations feel awkward and forced online, which is a missed opportunity for building team rapport.

                    “ I miss grabbing lunch with the team. All we talk about is work now.”

                <p class="margin-bottom-lv4">
                    These seemingly small, but meaningful in-person interactions such as stopping by a co-worker’s 
                    desk to catch up, are examples of how these conversations can foster social support, collaboration,
                    and satisfaction within the workplace. From our findings, 95% of survey respondents said it was 
                    difficult to socialize with their co-workers in a remote setting. Fostering authentic social 
                    relationships online is important in the workplace, for the sake of mental health and a 
                    productive team environment.

                <h4 class="margin-bottom-lv2">5/6 - Initial Exploration</h4>
                <p class="margin-bottom-lv6">Our initial solution proposal was called RADIO.io, a web application 
                    that allows remote teammates to connect to each other’s musical channels. However, what we were
                     proposing with RADIO felt too similar to other solutions, such as Tandem. Because of this, we 
                     decided to pivot and revisit the drawing board. 
                    <br><br>
                    One aspect that caused the major pivot was that RADIO.io required individuals to actively use 
                    the software. We were afraid that this would be too distracting, and their work performance would 
                    suffer.

                        We presented RADIO.io to our professor, but we were unhappy with the direction it was taking.

                    <p class="margin-bottom-lv8">Our goal with Workestra was to introduce more presence while bringing 
                        joy into the workday. Our solution balances a fine line between distraction and productivity. 
                        Therefore we opted for the main interaction to be passive, with the active interaction to be 
                        intentional methods of reaching out, such as shaking your co-workers to get their attention. 
                        <br><br>
                        Our form was inspired by chords in musical notation, where each team-member is represented by a 
                        note in a chord. We wanted co-workers to passively play music together. These sketches below 
                        were our basis for creating Workestra.

                <p class="margin-bottom-lv8">After finishing the final design, we realized there was no way to 
                    test our interaction. In the last few days of the Directed Study, we made a rough prototype 
                    to get an understanding of what Workestra would feel and sound like.

                    Although we weren’t able to connect users to our web-app, we coded a very patchy prototype 
                    to test the interaction.

                    Designing an application for the pandemic felt like we were working on real innovation. 
                    This problem space afforded exploration through many facets of remote work, due to new problems, presenting fruitful 
                    opportunities for intervention. We were debating on continuing this idea and bringing it to life, but due to a security 
                    issue with keylogging, we decided against it.
                    <br><br>
                    Although there were instances of struggle and frustration, we are extraordinarily proud of our creation. 
                    After completing the project, many of us showed Workestra to friends, family, and working professionals, 
                    and were blown away by the need for something like this in the workplace.

                        I co-led the interaction design alongside Audrey, but brought to life the 
                        interaction with a mix of prototyping tools, After Effects, Premiere Pro, 
                        and Audacity. User Research was conducted by the whole team, but I specifically 
                        focused on researching and understanding the importance of informal conversation 
                        in the workplace. I pulled key insights from both interviews and the literature 
                        review that ended up informing the final design decisions.
